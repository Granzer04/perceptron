"""
Weather Predictor for Jersey City, NJ
-------------------------------------
This script uses a simple neural network (MLP) to predict the next day's temperature in Jersey City, NJ, using recent weather data from the Open-Meteo API.

- The model's weights and scaler are saved in the 'model_weights/' folder for incremental learning.
- Each run loads previous weights (if available) and continues training, so the model can improve over time.
- Designed for beginners: clear comments and simple structure.

# How does the neural network learn?
# -------------------------------------------------
# The MLPRegressor is a type of neural network called a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
# It learns by adjusting its internal weights (numbers that control how much each input matters)
# to reduce the difference between its predictions and the actual temperatures.
#
# - Each input (recent temperatures) is multiplied by a weight.
# - The network adds up these weighted inputs, passes them through hidden layers (with their own weights),
#   and finally produces a prediction (the output).
# - After making a prediction, it checks how far off it was (the error).
# - It then tweaks the weights a little bit in the direction that would have made the prediction better.
# - This process is called backpropagation and is repeated for each training example.
# - Over time, the network "learns" the patterns in the data and gets better at predicting.
#
# In this script, the model is trained incrementally: each time you run it, it loads previous weights (if any),
# trains a bit more on the latest data, and saves the updated weights for next time.
